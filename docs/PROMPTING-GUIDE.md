"Which specs are waiting for approval?"
"What specs are currently in progress?"
```

#### Specific Status
```
"Show the status of the user-auth spec"
"What's the progress on payment-processing?"
"Show me what's left to do in the notification spec"
"Which tasks are completed in user-profile?"
```

#### Filtering
```
"Show me specs that are over 50% complete"
"List specs waiting for my approval"
"Which specs have no tasks completed yet?"
"Show blocked or stuck specs"
```

### Document Management

#### Viewing Documents
```
"Show me the requirements for user-auth"
"Display the design document for payments"
"What are the tasks for the notification system?"
"Show all documents for the search spec"
```

#### Updating Documents
```
"Update the user-auth requirements to include 2FA"
"Revise the payment design to use Stripe Connect"
"Add a task for security testing to user-profile"

```

#### Requesting Changes
```
"Request changes to the requirements:
- Add multi-tenant support
- Include rate limiting
- Specify data retention policy"
```

#### Rejecting
```
"Reject the current design - we need to use event-driven architecture instead"
"Start over with the requirements - the scope is too broad"
```

## Bug Workflow

### Reporting Bugs

#### Detailed Report
```
"Create a bug report:
Title: Login fails with special characters
Steps: 1) Enter email with '+' 2) Submit form 3) See error
Expected: Login succeeds
Actual: 500 error

"Implement a solution for the payment timeout issue"
"Fix the memory leak in the notification service"
```

## Mid-Implementation Changes

### When Specs Change During Development

Requirements and designs often evolve during implementation. When this happens, you need to keep tasks.md aligned with the current spec while preserving completed work.

### Using the Task Refresh Feature

The AI has access to comprehensive task refresh instructions through the refresh-tasks prompt. Simply inform the AI about your changes:

#### Basic Task Refresh
```
"The requirements have been updated. Please refresh tasks.md to align with the current requirements.md and design.md."
```

#### Detailed Task Refresh with Context
```
"I've updated the spec with the following changes:
- Removed the reporting module
- Changed database from MongoDB to PostgreSQL
- Added social login feature

Please refresh tasks.md following the task refresh process:
1. Preserve all completed and in-progress tasks
2. Add migration tasks for the database change
3. Remove pending tasks for the reporting module
4. Add new tasks for social login"
```

#### Architecture Change Requiring Migration
```
"We're switching from REST API to GraphQL. Several REST endpoints are already implemented. Please update tasks.md with:
1. All completed REST work preserved
2. Migration tasks to wrap REST logic in GraphQL resolvers
3. New GraphQL implementation tasks
4. Cleanup tasks to remove REST after GraphQL is verified"
```

### Expected AI Behavior

When you request a task refresh, the AI will:

1. **Analyze Current State**
   - Read requirements.md and design.md for current spec
   - Identify completed, in-progress, and pending tasks
   - Determine what features have been added, removed, or changed

2. **Preserve Completed Work**
   - Keep all [x] completed tasks unchanged
   - Keep all [-] in-progress tasks unchanged
   - Add notes when completed work is for removed features

3. **Handle Architecture Changes**
   - Add migration tasks after completed work that needs updating
   - Create transition tasks for progressive migration
   - Include verification tasks before removing old implementation

4. **Update Pending Tasks**
   - Remove pending tasks for deleted features
   - Update pending tasks for changed requirements
   - Add new tasks for new features

5. **Maintain Task Structure**
   - Keep sequential numbering
   - Preserve task format
   - Include requirement references
   - Maintain dependency order

### Example Scenarios

#### Feature Removal
```
"We've decided to remove the reporting module from the spec. Update tasks.md accordingly."
```

Expected AI behavior:
- Keep all completed reporting tasks with their [x] status
- Keep all in-progress reporting tasks with their [-] status
- Remove only pending [ ] reporting tasks
- Add note: "_Note: Reporting feature removed from spec but completed work preserved_"

#### Architecture Change with Completed Work
```
"We're switching from MongoDB to PostgreSQL. Update the pending database tasks. Note that we've already implemented MongoDB schemas and connection logic."
```

Expected AI behavior:
- Preserve all completed MongoDB tasks exactly as written
- Preserve all in-progress MongoDB tasks exactly as written
- Add new migration tasks immediately after completed MongoDB work:
  - Migrate MongoDB schemas to PostgreSQL tables
  - Replace MongoDB connection logic with PostgreSQL client
  - Update database queries from MongoDB to PostgreSQL syntax
  - Migrate existing MongoDB data to PostgreSQL
  - Update environment configuration for PostgreSQL
  - Remove MongoDB dependencies after migration verified
- Update remaining pending database tasks to use PostgreSQL
- Maintain task numbering sequence

#### Feature Addition
```
"Add social login to the authentication spec. The requirements and design have been updated."
```

Expected AI behavior:
- Analyze current task structure for logical insertion point
- Add new social login tasks with appropriate numbering
- Reference the specific requirements for social login
- Ensure new tasks maintain dependency order
- If basic auth is already implemented, add integration tasks

### Handling Architecture Migrations

When architecture changes affect already-implemented code:

#### REST to GraphQL Migration
```
"We're changing from REST to GraphQL. Several REST endpoints are already implemented."
```

Expected task additions:
- Preserve completed REST endpoint tasks
- Add GraphQL schema definition tasks
- Add resolver implementation tasks
- Add migration tasks to wrap existing REST logic in GraphQL resolvers
- Add tasks to update client code to use GraphQL
- Add cleanup tasks to remove REST endpoints after GraphQL is verified

#### Monolith to Microservices Split
```
"We're splitting the monolithic user service into separate auth and profile services."
```

Expected task additions:
- Preserve completed monolithic service tasks
- Add service separation tasks
- Add inter-service communication tasks
- Add data migration tasks if databases are splitting
- Add deployment configuration tasks for new services
- Add cleanup tasks to remove monolithic code after services are verified

### Task Format for Migrations

Migration tasks should clearly indicate their purpose:

```
"After refreshing tasks, I see you've added:
- [ ] 2.4 Migrate MongoDB schemas to PostgreSQL tables
  - File: src/database/migrations/mongo-to-postgres.ts
  - Convert document schemas to relational tables
  - Map embedded documents to foreign key relationships
  - Preserve all existing data relationships
  - Purpose: Transition database layer to new architecture
  - _Leverage: Completed MongoDB schemas in tasks 2.1-2.3_
  - _Requirements: Design section 3.2_"
```

### Communicating Changes to AI

When informing the AI about spec changes:

#### Be Specific About Changes and Impact
```
"The payment processing requirements have changed. Stripe is now required instead of PayPal. We've already implemented PayPal webhook handlers. Please update tasks.md to reflect this change, including migration tasks."
```

#### Provide Context for Preservation and Migration
```
"Although we're moving from MongoDB to PostgreSQL, keep all completed MongoDB tasks since that work is already done. Add migration tasks to transition the implemented MongoDB code to PostgreSQL."
```

#### Request Validation
```
"After updating tasks.md, confirm that all requirements in requirements.md have corresponding tasks, migration paths exist for architecture changes, and that no pending tasks exist for removed features."
```

### Progressive Migration Strategy

For major architecture changes, the AI should create tasks that support progressive migration:

1. Implement new architecture alongside existing
2. Add compatibility layer tasks
3. Migrate functionality incrementally
4. Verify each migration step
5. Remove old implementation only after full verification

This ensures the application remains functional throughout the transition.

### Using the Refresh Tasks Prompt

You can also explicitly invoke the refresh tasks prompt:

```
"Use the refresh-tasks prompt for the user-auth spec. The changes are: switched from JWT to OAuth2 for authentication."
```

The AI will then follow the comprehensive refresh instructions to update your tasks while preserving all completed work.

## Advanced Patterns

### Multi-Spec Workflows

#### Related Specs
```
"Create a spec for admin-dashboard that integrates with:
- user-management spec
- analytics spec
- reporting spec"
```

#### Spec Dependencies
```
"Create a spec for notifications that depends on:
- user-auth being complete
- message-queue being implemented
- email-service being available"
```

### Incremental Development

#### MVP First
```
"Create an MVP spec for user-profiles with just:
- Basic profile creation
- Display name and avatar
- Public profile view
(We'll add social features later)"
```

#### Enhancement Specs
```
"Create an enhancement spec for user-auth adding:
- Social login (Google, GitHub)
- Biometric authentication
- Enhanced session management
- Account linking"
```

### Complex Scenarios

#### Migration Specs
```
"Create a spec for migrating from MongoDB to PostgreSQL:
- Document current schema

- Include rollback procedures"
```

#### Refactoring Specs
```
"Create a refactoring spec to:
- Split the monolith into services
- Extract shared components
- Improve test coverage to 80%
- Maintain backward compatibility"
```

#### Performance Specs
```
"Create a performance optimization spec:
- Profile current bottlenecks
- Design caching strategy

```

## Context-Aware Prompts

### Using Project Context
```
"Create a spec that follows our existing patterns"
"Implement this task consistent with our codebase"
"Design this feature to integrate with our current architecture"
```

### Referencing Other Specs
```
"Create a spec similar to user-auth but for admin authentication"
"Use the same design patterns as in the payment spec"
"Follow the task structure from our notification spec"
```

### Building on Previous Work
```
"Extend the user-auth spec to include team management"
"Add GraphQL support to the existing REST API spec"
"Enhance the search spec with machine learning features"
```

## Tips for Effective Prompting

### Be Specific
❌ **Vague**: "Create a login spec"
✅ **Specific**: "Create a spec for email/password login with 2FA, remember me, and password reset"

### Provide Context
❌ **No context**: "Implement the task"
✅ **With context**: "Implement task 1.2 using our existing Express middleware and PostgreSQL database"

### Set Clear Expectations
❌ **Unclear**: "Make it better"
✅ **Clear**: "Improve the design to handle 10x current traffic with response times under 200ms"

### Use Incremental Requests
❌ **Too much**: "Create 5 specs and implement everything"
✅ **Incremental**: "Create the user-auth spec first, then we'll review before moving to the next"

### Reference Existing Work
❌ **Starting fresh**: "Create a new payment system"
✅ **Building on**: "Enhance our payment spec to add subscription billing"
